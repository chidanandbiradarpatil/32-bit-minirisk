This project was developed and tested using the free online platform EDA Playground.

EDA Playground provides a browser-based environment where multiple hardware
description languages such as Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL, C/C++, and others
can be executed without any local installation. For this project:

• Verilog HDL was used to implement the Mini RISC 32-bit pipelined processor.
• A separate testbench file was created to verify functionality and behavior.
• The simulator selected on EDA Playground was "Icarus Verilog 12.0".
• Waveform visualization was performed using EPWave.
• All output messages and runtime information were observed through the console.

EDA Playground acted only as the coding and simulation environment.
Visual Studio Code was used solely for:
    – organizing project files,
    – initializing Git,
    – committing updates,
    – and pushing the final project to the GitHub repository.

This ensures that the design, simulation, and verification are done online,
while version control and repository management are handled locally via VS Code.
